	<h2> <center> Garlic cheese kulcha </center> </h2>
<p>Shredded mozzarella for the kulcha stuffing but you can also use Amul processed cheese or a combination of cheddar and mozzarella. Mozzarella melts and gives you that cheese pull which won't happen if you use regular Amul Cheese.
Chaat Masala adds an amazing tanginess that's hard to beat. We call the flavour 'chatpata' in Hindi. If you can source chaat masala, please do. If you can't, you can also switch things up with some taco seasoning, or cajun spice mix - it'll be a different flavour but still so good.</p>

	<h2> <center> Chinese potli samosa wontons </center></h2>
<p>Serve them in a garlic sauce that was spicy, soupy and so irresistible. The trick was to add them to bubbling sauce just before serving so that the fried wonton covering was still crisp, but just soaking with sauce. It's a fine balance that mum was treading with this recipe, but it always worked. By the time we were served these, the covering would become softer but still hold it's own and the sauce would permeate the insides to make the noodle filling even better.</p>

	<h2 style="text-align: center;"> <center>Chilli paneer - street style </center> </h2>
<ul>
	<li>Soggy chilli paneer in which the fried skin peels off of the paneer cubes is not at all a pleasant experience.</li>
	<li>The fried cubes of paneer should have a light crunch to them even after being tossed in the sauce.</li>

<li>The trick is to dry coat the paneer instead of using a wet batter so that the coating doesn’t come off while stir frying. </li>
<li> The dry coating is a simple mixture of cornflour, kashmiri chilli powder, salt and a splash of water.</li> </ul>

	<h2> Railway Style Veg Cutlets </h2>
<ol>
	<li>Pressure cooking is the fastest way to cook root vegetables like beets, potatoes and carrots and makes them easy to mash later</li>
<li>The green paste is a fantastic way to add flavour. When you grind together ginger, garlic, chillies, mint and coriander, magic happens!</li>
<li>Unconventional binding agents like poha and cornflour are my preferred choice for cutlets. These keep the cutlets from drying out, while making sure they don't fall apart</li>
<li>Don't mash the veggies too smooth. A little texture and chunkiness is nice to bite into</li>

	<td> This iconic and ever-evolving chain, nothing embodies "eatin' good in the neighborhood" quite like the Bourbon Street Chicken and Shrimp — a heap of Cajun-seasoned chicken and blackened shrimp in garlic butter, served on a sizzling cast-iron platter along with sauteed mushrooms, onions and crispy red potatoes. Since December 2015, Applebee's has served more than 46 million of these dishes.</td>

	<td> Come for the often-imitated, never-duplicated Cheddar Bay Biscuits. Stay for the Ultimate Feast, Red Lobster's fan-favorite entree. In this case, "feast" is not hyperbole: It's a platter heaped with tender Maine lobster tail, steamed North American snow crab legs and garlic shrimp scampi — in addition to butterflied, hand-breaded, golden fried shrimp. Remember to save room for the parade of all-included salad, coleslaw and biscuits..</td>

<h3 style="font-style: italic;">  My Name is Yeh is definitely the place to be, actually… to reside. It’s the place to go if you have young children and are looking for some sweet, colorful, delicious inspiration. I don’t know if her former musical training has given her the recognition food has – besides her cookbook, Molly has appeared on famous TV food networks and various TV shows – but her beautifully inspired fairy tale desserts, ephemeral pieces of art, surely have!</h3>
